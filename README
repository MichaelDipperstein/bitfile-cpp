DESCRIPTION
-----------
This archive contains an ISO C++ class implementing bitwise reading and
writing for sequential files.  This class is intended to be easy to follow
and expand upon, though it may be used without an understanding of its
implementation.

FILES
-----
bitfile.cpp     - Class implementing bitwise reading and writing for
                  sequential files.
bitfile.h       - Header for bitfile class.
sample.cpp      - Program demonstrating how to use the bitfile class. 
LICENSE         - GNU Lesser General Public License
Makefile        - makefile for this project (assumes gcc compiler and GNU make)
README          - this file

BUILDING
--------
To build these files with GNU make and gcc, simply enter "make" from the
command line.

USAGE
-----
sample.cpp demonstrates usage of each of the bitfile methods.

HISTORY
-------
08/04/04 - Initial release
06/21/05 - Corrected GetBits/PutBits error that accessed an extra byte
           when given an integral number of bytes.
12/08/05 - Added methods to get/put bits from/to integer types.
02/09/06 - Corrected bug in GetBit discovered by Peter Husemann.  A
           0xFF byte may be recognized as an EOF.

TODO
----
- Consider adding extra count so that files ending in incomplete bytes
  may be appended to starting with the incomplete byte instead of the
  next whole byte.
- Test on platforms with character lengths other than 8 bits.
